# Estimating Latent Variables with Gradient Descent
This simple model allows to test the estimation of latent 
variables given generated noisy observations.
Example usage is the estimation of unknown (medical) 
treatment times for each treatment type given the information 
on what treatments where performed by each healthcare provider 
on a daily basis.
